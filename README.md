# configuration files for talonvoice.com

Currently a work in progress.

Much of the base has been borrowed from many other users. Particularly,

- [lexjacobs](https://github.com/lexjacobs/talon_user)
- [dwighthouse](https://github.com/dwighthouse/talonvoice-scripts)
- [official examples](https://github.com/talonvoice/examples)

You will notice that a lot of the stuff here has some odd words and probably deviates from others.
Since I was a former VoiceCode user, some of the language has been influenced from there.

Put these in `~/.talon/user`.
